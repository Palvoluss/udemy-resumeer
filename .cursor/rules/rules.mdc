# IMPORTANT:
# Always read memory-bank/@architecture.md before writing any code. Include entire database schema.
# Always read memory-bank/@product-requirements.md before writing any code.
# After adding a major feature or completing a milestone, update memory-bank/@architecture.md
# Always prefer modularity (multiple files) and discourage a monolith (one giant file) 
# prefer to use clean code architecture and code human readability
